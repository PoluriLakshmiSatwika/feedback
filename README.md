The Feedback System is a full-stack web application designed to collect, manage, and analyze user feedback efficiently. Built using Flask for the backend and MySQL for database management, the system allows users to submit feedback through a user-friendly interface. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensures a smooth user experience. The system categorizes feedback, stores it securely, and provides administrators with insights for decision-making. Future enhancements include sentiment analysis for feedback evaluation and data visualization for improved reporting.
